Solutions as per the given problem statements and Explanations

Problem 1:
Expected Input format:
  Example: {-7,-5,-3,-1,3,6,9} 
  Explanation : As the imput is always(default) string,
                the braces ("{" , "}") at both the ends are stripped
                and rest of the string is processed to be 
                stored in form of an array. 
                {Note: A function is written to take input in form of arraylist but it is commented.}
                
                
Problem 2: 
Expected Input/Output:
    Example:
            Enter test cases2
            Enter no. of elements2
            3
            4
            result = 12
            Enter no. of elements1
            15
            result = 15
            Exit 
     Note: Check for the constraints are made so any input crossing the boundaries will raise an error
